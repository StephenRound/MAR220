//i had an idea for plants, originally. these would act like fly traps,
//sort of. they wouldn't actually try to actively eat the flies at first
//(subsequent iterations of this sketch would allow for that) but instead
//they would snap upwards, probably to a maximum of 3/4s of the height,
//before slowly dwindling back down to the ground.
